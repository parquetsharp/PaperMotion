/**
 * Per-tag visualization-spec agent.

 * Hands a typed VizSpec back to the caller. Used by both the legacy

 *
 * Behaviour:
 *   • Builds the prompt for the requested viz type (3D / 2d-anim /
 *     formula / graph / 2d-text).
 *   • If a previous attempt is supplied with its runtime error, prepends
 *     a repair preamble (the codex SDK gets `reasoning: "medium"` for
 *     these to spend a little extra thought).
 *   • Server-side syntax pre-flight (via the same `compileFn` the client
 *     runtime uses) for the two code-emitting types (3D, 2d-anim): if the
 *     generated JS doesn't compile, we throw with the compiler's reason so
 *     the failure is surfaced to the user (single-attempt — no auto-repair).

${LANGUAGE_RULE}

Return a structured step-by-step lesson, not a video or executable code.
Use a concrete worked example grounded in the source. For algorithms show
the actual successive states of that algorithm, including inputs, each
important transition, termination, and the result. Verify the example by
tracing it before responding. Do not invent unsupported scientific claims.

code: short pseudocode lines (up to 24), not executable JavaScript.
steps: 2 to 30 complete snapshots. Each has a title, explanation, active
1-based code line (0 means none), variables, diagram items, and links.
Each diagram item has a stable id, short label and value, column and row
(integers 0 through 3), and state neutral/active/complete/warning.
Positions must be unique within each step. Use no more than four columns
or four rows. Keep stable item IDs and positions across snapshots when
possible. Links reference existing item IDs within the same step. Use
short labels. Every step must be independently renderable, including
backward navigation. Explain WHY a transition happens, not just what moves.
The reader can play, pause, change speed, scrub, and move one step at a time.`,

${LANGUAGE_RULE}

Produce a JSON object matching the schema. The "setup_code" field MUST be
a JavaScript function BODY (do NOT wrap it in 'function setup() { ... }')
that the framework invokes as
   new Function("api", body)({ THREE, scene, camera, renderer, controls, group });

The body MUST do all of the following:
  - position the camera somewhere sensible (e.g. camera.position.set(0, 1.6, 4))
  - set scene.background = new THREE.Color('#fafafa')  (the app uses a
    light theme; the renderer canvas sits on a white card)
  - add an ambient light + a directional light suitable for the light theme
  - build meshes that ACCURATELY represent the concept and add them to
    'group' (the framework auto-rotates the group). Be creative and
    domain-aware: a heart needs distinct atria + ventricles + great
    vessels; methane needs the central carbon + 4 hydrogens at
    tetrahedral angles (109.5°); benzene needs a planar hexagonal carbon
    ring with hydrogens; a cell needs nucleus + visible organelles.
  - return an object with an optional update(t) callback for animation.
    't' is the elapsed time in SECONDS since start (a float growing by ~0.016
    per frame). Use 't' DIRECTLY (e.g. group.rotation.y = t * 0.5); do NOT
    multiply or divide it by 1000 or 0.001 — it is seconds, not milliseconds.

CONSTRAINTS:
  - Use ONLY 'THREE' (already imported) and standard math globals (Math, etc).
  - DO NOT use external loaders, textures, image URLs, or asset files.
  - DO NOT touch 'document', 'window', 'fetch', 'import', 'require', 'eval'.
  - DO NOT use OrbitControls — the framework already auto-rotates the
    group and reacts to pointer drag/scroll. Ignore the 'controls' arg.
  - Keep the total scene under ~200 primitives.
  - All meshes MUST be added to 'group' (not 'scene') so the framework can
    orbit them.
  - Use plain string concatenation ('foo ' + x) NOT template literals
    (\`foo \${x}\`) — backticks tend to get mangled in JSON encoding.
  - Material colors should read clearly against #fafafa (avoid pure white
    surfaces; prefer mid-tone fills with subtle MeshStandardMaterial).
  - Every '(' must close with ')', every '{' with '}', every '[' with ']'.
    The body is NOT wrapped in an outer function, so do NOT add a trailing
    '}' to "close" one — your braces must balance exactly on their own.`,

  "2d-anim": `You are Get It.'s visualizer 2D Canvas animation generator.

${LANGUAGE_RULE}

Produce a JSON object matching the schema. The "setup_code" field MUST be
a JavaScript function BODY invoked as
   new Function("api", body)({ ctx, width, height });
The body MUST return an object { draw(ctx, width, height, time, dt) }.
UNITS: 'time' is the elapsed time in SECONDS since the animation started (a
float that grows by ~0.016 each frame); 'dt' is the SECONDS since the previous
frame (~0.016). Drive motion with 'time' DIRECTLY, e.g. Math.sin(time * 2).
Do NOT multiply or divide 'time'/'dt' by 1000 or 0.001 — they are already in
seconds, never milliseconds. (Scaling 'time' by 0.001 makes the animation
appear frozen.)

The draw callback runs every frame. Build an INFORMATIVE animation:
  - inclined plane: slope, block sliding with correct g·sin(θ) acceleration
  - pendulum: bob swinging with correct period 2π√(L/g)
  - projectile: parabolic trajectory traced over time
  - spring oscillation: mass on spring with amplitude decay
  - blood flow: vessel cross-section with cells flowing
  - chemical reaction: reactant molecules colliding and forming products
  - water cycle, etc.

Always paint a clean light background ('#fafafa') as the FIRST step of draw
so previous frames are erased. Use legible ink colors against that
background — pick from this palette:
  ink     #1a1a1d   (text, primary outlines)
  rose    #e11d48   (warning / accent A)
  amber   #d97706   (warning / accent B)
  emerald #059669   (positive / motion)
  violet  #7c3aed   (highlight)
  sky     #0284c7   (cool secondary)
Add labelled axes / annotations with ctx.fillText so the meaning is
self-evident.

CONSTRAINTS:
  - DO NOT touch document, window, fetch, import, require, eval.
  - DO NOT load images.
  - Use only 'ctx' (CanvasRenderingContext2D) plus Math globals.
  - Restart the animation cleanly when 'time' resets to 0.
  - Use plain string concatenation ('foo ' + x) NOT template literals
    (\`foo \${x}\`) — backticks tend to get mangled in JSON encoding.
  - Every '(' must close with ')', every '{' with '}', every '[' with ']'.
    The body is NOT wrapped in an outer function, so do NOT add a trailing
    '}' to "close" one — your braces must balance exactly on their own.`,

  formula: `You are Get It's visualizer formula generator.

${LANGUAGE_RULE}

Produce a JSON object matching the schema:
  - main_latex: the headline equation (no $ delimiters; KaTeX-compatible).
  - steps: 2 to 6 derivation/explanation steps, each with one LaTeX line
    plus a one-sentence explanation. Walk the reader from definition to
    result.
Avoid \\begin{align} environments unless necessary; prefer simple lines.`,

  graph: `You are Get It.'s visualizer graph generator.

${LANGUAGE_RULE}

Produce a JSON object matching the schema. The "data_json" field MUST be a
STRING containing JSON (it will be JSON.parse'd on the client). Pick a
chart_type and fill data_json accordingly:

  chart_type="function": data_json = '{"fn":"<expr in x>","x_min":-5,"x_max":5,"samples":200}'
       The expression must be valid JS using x and Math.* (e.g. "Math.sin(x)*x").
  chart_type="points":   data_json = '{"points":[[x,y], ...]}'
  chart_type="bars":     data_json = '{"bars":[{"label":"A","value":1.0}, ...]}'
  chart_type="lines":    data_json = '{"series":[{"name":"foo","color":"#5b66f1","points":[[x,y],...]}]}'

Pick sensible domain & sampling. Make the chart visually communicate the
concept (e.g. range R = v0² sin(2α)/g plotted as α sweeps 0 to 90; or the
bell curve; or a parabola). Use color hex strings; the chart engine
renders on a white background.`,

  "2d-text": `You are Get It.'s visualizer text-source generator.

${LANGUAGE_RULE}

Produce a JSON object matching the schema. The viewer expects an
authoritative card: a title, a short caption, a body in markdown that
quotes or summarises the cited source, and a list of 1–4 citations with
stable URLs (Wikipedia, official government sites, arxiv, etc).

If you have web search available, use it to confirm the citation text and
URL; otherwise produce the best high-confidence quote you know. Prefer
direct quotation in italics for legal articles. Add bracketed source
labels in the text like [1], [2] linking to the citations array order.`,
